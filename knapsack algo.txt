Algorithm:

1.	Declare a table DP[][] of size (Number of items+1*Capacity+1) to store the intermediate states and initialise it with ‘-1’ denoting all states as blank.
2.	Define a function knapsack which takes as argument (`W->Weight left to be filled, ‘N’->number of left items)
3.	Base case will be if we have ‘left weight=0’ or ‘number of items left=0’ , then return 0
4.	Also consider the case when DP[i][j]!=-1 then straight away return that state as it is previously calculated.
5.	If the current item’s weight is greater than left weight so that item cannot be included therefore return DP[n-1][W]=knapsack(n-1,W)
6.	Else return DP[n-1][W]= max(val+knapsack(W-val,n-1),knapsack(W-val,n-1)) which means returning the maximum of the two cases when the current item is included or not included
